# Breast_cancer_perceptron_model
## Dataset
* The dataset is loaded from sklearn load dataset library which loads the dataset from UCI Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset. The dataset link is https://goo.gl/U2Uwz2.
* The dataset contains two classes (1 and 0), 1 being malignant and 0 being benign. Benign tumors are the one in which the cells are not cancerous and wont spread. On the other hand, malignant tumors are such that the cells are cancerous and can spread to other tissues and organs.
* The dataset has 30 features which is referred as independent variables. The class feature is referred as target/dependent variable.

## Perceptron model

* The prediction of the Breast cancer is done using simple perceptron model. 
* The perceptron model is a two-class binary classification machine learning algorithm. 
* It is the simplest type of neural network and consists of single neuron that takes input as features and predicts the output (class label).
* The perceptron model works on the principal of adding weights to each of the features.
